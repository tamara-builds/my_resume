        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Software engineer who builds backend systems, APIs, and data pipelines in Python, TypeScript,
          and Ruby. I like working close to the mechanics of a system, especially when something breaks
          and I need to trace it back to the underlying behavior. I work closely with others from early
          exploration through implementation, contributing to design tradeoffs, testing, and iteration as
          requirements evolve. I care about whether the systems I build actually help people make sense
          of complex, real-world data and hold up under real-world constraints. Before software, I
          worked internationally in education and community programs, including civic and public-interest
          contexts, which shaped how I collaborate, communicate, and design with judgment rather than ego.

            Open-source civic data tooling that addresses a core problem in legislative data: it is fragmented,
            difficult to track over time, and often dependent on centralized platforms that may be shut down or abandoned.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented automated ETL pipelines that transform raw Open States legislative data into
              normalized, append-only JSON artifacts suitable for long-term analysis, auditing, and replay.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built workflows around reproducibility and decentralization using timestamped artifacts, structured logs,
              and deterministic runs so datasets can be independently cloned, verified, and queried by others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Standardized ETL patterns across jurisdictions and legislative sessions, reducing duplicated effort for civic
              groups, researchers, and educators without dedicated data infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented Docker-based runs and GitHub Actions schedules to support transparent, repeatable updates and
              reduce manual intervention.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with civic technologists and researchers to refine data structures and tooling based on downstream
              analytics, tagging, and public-facing use rather than theoretical schemas.
