### About

I’m the person who lights up when something breaks, because it’s an opportunity to learn how a system works and make it better. Before learning to code, I worked around the world in roles that taught me to listen closely, adapt quickly, and understand how systems behave in real contexts. I taught science in Mexico and China and supported community programs in India and Kenya. Today, I contribute to civic tech projects, design and build backend systems, and develop pipelines and APIs that turn unstructured data into clean, usable formats in Python, TypeScript, and Ruby. I’m comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces, taking ownership from early exploration through implementation, and improving systems incrementally as requirements and constraints evolve.

### Highlighted Projects

#### govbot (Windy Civi Toolkit)

**Python | GitHub Actions | Docker | JSON | ETL | Structured Logging | Data Validation**

Open source civic data tooling that addresses a core infrastructure problem: legislative data is fragmented, difficult to track over time, and often dependent on centralized platforms that may be shut down or abandoned.

* Built automated pipelines transforming federal and state legislative data into standardized, append only JSON artifacts for long term analysis and reuse.
* Designed reproducible workflows using timestamped outputs and structured logs so datasets can be independently cloned, verified, and queried.
* Standardized ETL patterns across jurisdictions and legislative sessions, reducing duplicated effort for civic groups, researchers, and educators.
* Implemented Dockerized runs and scheduled GitHub Actions to support repeatable data updates and transparent execution.

#### SciScope

**Node.js | Express | PostgreSQL | Redis | JWT | Caching | Jest | CI/CD**

A RESTful API for science news aggregation with authentication, caching, and analytics.

* Built modular API with external news integration and layered caching.
* Designed PostgreSQL schema and wrote advanced queries for pagination and analytics.
* Automated testing and CI workflows using Jest and GitHub Actions.

#### Adventure Life REST API

**Node.js | TypeScript | Express | PostgreSQL | Knex | Objection.js | Swagger**

Refactored a legacy API into a clean, testable TypeScript backend.

* Modeled complex relational data with Objection.js and PostgreSQL.
* Built modular async workflows and documented endpoints with Swagger.
* Wrote a comprehensive Jest test suite to support long term maintainability.
